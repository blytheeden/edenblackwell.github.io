        <div><p1>Iâ€™m a PhD student in Biocultural Medical Anthropology. My previous degrees are in international studies 
            and sociology (BA) from the University of Mississippi and international health and development (MPH)
            from Tulane University. Much of my professional experience has been in health policy, a field I maintain
            a passion for and one I hope to complement through a study of biocultural medical anthropology. My
            research interests involve the impacts of climate change on human health and culture, human-
            environment interactions, and global health, broadly. Ongoing research involves subsistence farming in Ethiopia.

                <div><article3>My preliminary work on impacts of climate change on smallholder farmers in Ethiopia was accepted 
                    for a poster session American Anthropological Association's Annual Meeting in Seattle. It was a 
                    great opportunity to connect with other anthropologists in the country as well as see the work of 
                    others in other regions on the continent.

                <div><article5>Since I try to keep one foot in the the health policy world while working on my doctorate, I'm always
                     delighted to talk to students of health policy or public health.  In November, and for the third year now, I 
                     gave a lecture about recent health policy and related research in Mississippi to master's students in health 
                     administration at the University of Southern Miss. My slides are available here. </article5></div>

                <div><article4>Just back from a few weeks of fieldwork on the outskirts of a Hawassa City in Ethiopia 
                    where I supported research related to stress and child development.  While there I had the opportunity
                    to do exploratory work related to my interests in climate change and health.  I led focus groups and conducted
                    individual interviews with farmers about their perceptions of change in long-term weather patterns and how they 
                    were coping with the impacts to their livelihoods and the health of their families.  Results to share soon!
